    Imagine a game where a character runs along an infinite obstacle path. The further the character gets the softer currency and points players will get. Players use the points to boast about their top scores and the soft currency to improve their characters. Thus, by eliminating the risk of players ‘running out’ of content, these types of games are a dream come true for modern game developers. Theme is very important in an app store filled with free titles because of two things. Firstly, themes help you to get that download. Think about it. You stumble upon a free pirate game in the AppStore. try to make it so that players can play your game with one hand only. You want them to play your game while commuting and having one hand free makes it a lot safer to do so. I am not going to talk about average revenue per paying player, as all of the infinite runners have very similar, and thus very low, price points. Instead, I’ll take a deeper look on how well different games in this genre create demand that drives players to convert to payers. A great way to create demand for fast tracking the progress is to encourage players to compare their progress with one another. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter what your top score is in a endless struggle game. It is only a game you play now and then. But once you see your friend’s score and try to beat it just to see it beaten, things are starting to get serious.

    <dd>Despite the huge amount of time spent across gaming, from console to casual mobile gaming, the understanding and investment from marketers is still in early stages. Consumers spend as much time playing mobile games as using social media, around 35% of total screen time this has been the case for years. During the pandemic, we have seen an increase of 48% in consumers gaming daily, and this has been a genuine tipping point for the adoption of gaming as a channel by many brands and marketers. Brands and marketers are now keen to lean into and maximize the gaming opportunity, as one of the largest gaming focused advertising platforms and a business really focused on bringing brands and consumers together in gaming, we are keen to help. We see gaming as a channel, we anticipate agencies and brands building out gaming teams in the same way they have historically built out social teams. This will help plug a lot of gaps. Keep it simple - just buy ads! Gaming in general (and in-app mobile gaming especially) is a high reach, brand-safe channel to deliver video or display at scale, so just transfer what you already do on YouTube or Facebook i.e., buying targeted ads. This is a super simple, instant way to capture the gaming opportunity. This means really defining your brand purpose around gaming, and why you are investing. It is a time-heavy investment but rewarding if you have identified it’s the right thing for your marketing strategy. We have seen many fashions brands deep-diving into gaming, they see it as a cultural originator in the same way they saw street fashion 20-30 years ago.
